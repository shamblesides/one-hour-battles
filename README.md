# One-Hour Battle Collection
This is a collection of my One-Hour HTML Battle submissions from battleofthebits.org.
Although the site is mainly geared towards music-making competitions, occasionally it
also hosts competitions involving pixel art or, as you see here, webpages. I haven't
done any more of these since 2014 but I think it'd be fun to do again!

The theme of this contest was to create "a website about nature/landscapes/earth/or anything similar!"
I decided to flex my newly-forming JavaScript muscles and make something cool and generative.

This one got last place, but would have gotten 2nd if I didn't incur a large penalty for submitting
10 minutes late...

The prompt for this one was that you were hired by 4chan to design a new website for them.
I did something very silly. This is probably my least favorite entry but also my most successful;
it got second place, and the majority of the voters gave it a 6/7 or 7/7 star rating.

I decided the prompt for this contest: "a soothing webpage you could spend hours on. JavaScript
required." I bet that it could be a good component of a Tumblr theme.
